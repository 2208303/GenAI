Agent Router Accuracy
	
Evaluates whether the agent selected the correct tool or skill based on the intent of the user query.Input Data: User query, selected tool, expected (ideal) tool.


Parameter Extraction Accuracy
	
Validates whether the agent accurately extracted necessary parameters required by the tool without adding fabricated or missing values.Input Data: User query, tool/function JSON schema.


Tool Execution Validity
	
Checks if the final function or tool call made by the agent is syntactically valid and executable.Input Data: Tool call object (tool name + parameters).


Task Completion Rate
	
Measures if the agent successfully accomplished the end goal of the user based on the correctness and completeness of the final output.Input Data: User goal/intent, final output.


Query-to-Skill Robustness
	
Tests the robustness of the agent in routing various phrasings of the same intent consistently to the correct tool or skill.Input Data: Set of paraphrased queries, corresponding routed tools.


Agent Plan & Reasoning Check
	
Evaluates the quality and coherence of the agent’s reasoning process and whether it formed a logical and goal-directed plan.Input Data: Thought steps (reasoning trace), action plan, intermediate decisions.


Agent Trajectory Alignment
	
Assesses whether the agent followed the expected or optimal path of actions/tool calls toward task completion and identifies unjustified deviations.Input Data: Actual agent trajectory (tool/action sequence), reference/expected trajectory.


Self-Assessment Consistency
	
Measures the alignment between the agent’s self-evaluation (reflexion) and the actual correctness or quality of its final output.Input Data: Final output, agent's reflection or confidence statement.
